A solution to the longest common subsequence algorithm in Rust

Based on the table from the Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#:~:text=A%20longest%20common%20subsequence%20(LCS,(often%20just%20two%20sequences).

I specifically wanted to try to implement this in a data structure that could keep track of the values at any point in time like can be seen in the tables in the link above.


TODO: Maybe use https://github.com/yishn/wasm-react to make a web app out of this that fills a table row by row like Wikipedia
